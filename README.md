## Presentations

A Presentation (more to come) I've been working on for lightning talks.

## View

There are two ways to view the presentations:

### Install [`reveal-md`](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md)

- Initialize: `npx reveal-md {folder}/PITCHME.md`
- Example: `npm reveal-md customize-the-web/PITCHME.md`

### Open with [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/)

Click on the thumbnail to start the presentation

| [![Userscripts & Bookmarklets](userscripts/images/thumb-userscripts-bookmarklets.png)](https://gitpitch.com/Mottie/presentations/master?p=userscripts) |

To do: Build presentations directly to gh-pages using actions (GitPitch shutting down 3/2021)
